Introduction

Sparkle Society is a budding makeup company that produces different beauty products. To gain traction, Sparkle Society has recently run some social media promotions and also debuted itself on big e-commerce sites to complement purchases from its website.

Problem statement:

As thousands of reviews pour in from social media and e-commerce sites, it has become necessary for the company to know how the different make-up products are being received on the market for informed decision-making.

NLP Task:

As a data scientist in the company, the lead data scientist has asked me to build an end-to-end NLP sentiment analysis pipeline. In this pipeline, I will create a model to classify reviews as positive or negative. By automating the classification of the reviews, Sparkle Society will extract insights from customer feedback to identify product improvement areas and customer pain points. The goal is to curate make-up products that customers love, increasing sales and the companyâ€™s growth. The company hopes to integrate the model into decision-making processes to drive strategic market advantages.
